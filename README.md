# Kattis Hint Giver v2

## Shows hints on the bottom of a problem page

This project is a fork of the old Kattis Hint Giver that shows kattis hints in the new UI design.
The differences are:
- We updated the extension to use a service worker and manifest v3.
- Added support for wildcards so that the extension works on university subdomains.
- We no longer show tooltips on the problem listing.
- We have removed the jQuery and tooltip dependencies.
